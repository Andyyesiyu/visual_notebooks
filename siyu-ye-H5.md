## 1. Matplotlib

* What is the license for the software?

  The Matplotlib license is based on the Python Software Foundation (PSF) license.

  As the official website, Prior to July of 2013, and the 1.3.0 release, the copyright of the source code was held by John Hunter. As of July 2013, and the 1.3.0 release, matplotlib has moved to a shared copyright model. 

* What is the focus of the software?

  Matplotlib aims to make easy things easy and hard things possible. Users can use several lines to create a plot and also can fully personalize the plot with full control of styles, fonts, axes. It provides a Matlab like interface and the control styles is similar to Matlab which makes its friendly to Matlab users. 

* Does it have interactivity, and how easy is it?

  It supports interactivity across platforms. It can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.

  It can used easily and also can be complex for personizling. For a bar plot, only one lines is enough, use `plt.bar()`. Users can also access to other elements individually. 

* What are the pros and cons of using it?

  Pros: It is an efficiently package to generate simple plots with several lines of codes. Super friendly for Matlab users. Fully integrated with Pandas and Numpy.  Included in Anaconda packages, easy to upgrade and install. Perfect documentation and tutorial from installation to commercial usage. 

  Cons: Although it supports custom styles, the default one has not aesthetic style and colors. Not enough interactivity. Limited graph types. 

## 2. Bqplot

* What is the license for the software?

  Apache License 2.0. It is a permissive license whose main conditions require preservation of copyright and license notices.

* What is the focus of the software?

  It focuses more on interactive web applications in Python. It currently only supports Jupyter Notebook and other IPython shells. Users can use widget to play with the plots in bound to Python functions. 

* Does it have interactivity, and how easy is it?

  Entirely interactivity. Relatively use to use, but should learn some basic concepts. To plot a simple bar plot, users should first generate a figure then use embedded function to draw a bar plot. To interact with the plots, the widgets are essential to learn, which will make it a little bit tricky. 

* What are the pros and cons of using it?

  Pros: Fancy interactive support. Colorful themes and eye-catching plots out of box. Fully integrated with Pandas and Numpy. 

  Cons: Can only work in Jupyter Notebook and IPython. Not enough documentation. Hard to install and upgrade because of dependency. Not easy to learn at first stage. 

## 3. D3

* What is the license for the software?

  BSD 3. BSD 3 is a permissive free software licenses, imposing minimal restrictions on the use and distribution of covered software. 

* What is the focus of the software?

  It is a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web environment. It uses SVG as the key ideas behind all visualizations. D3 solves the crux of the problem: efficient manipulation of documents based on data.

* Does it have interactivity, and how easy is it?

  Fully interactivity. Very hard to use for beginners. First it does not aim to be a out of box library, so users could develop tools based on D3.js. This is the main reason, why it is hard to use. To draw a bar plot, in JavaScript file, users should know how to import D3.js in head. User should first make a HTML website then customize the SVG background. Then users even need match the data with each bar manually. The examples would be near 50 lines of code totally.

* What are the pros and cons of using it?

  Pros: High efficient in DOM manipulation. Fully customizable components and good reusability. Support fancy interactivity with the help of CSS. Could publish based on web technology. Perfect documentation and strong community (90k+ star and 20k+ fork in Github).

  Cons: Hard to learn and with steep learning curve. Not out of box visualization library. Only work for web developers, hard to draw offline.

## 4. R/RStudio

* What is the license for the software?

  R as a package is licensed under GPL-2 | GPL-3.

  RStudio is available under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.

  RStudio also offers a commercial desktop license for RStudio and a commercial license for RStudio Server Pro.

* What is the focus of the software?

  R language is widely used among statisticians, data analysis and other related software development. It is quite versatile. To compare with other ones above, we mainly focus on the data visualization part. It mainly focus on the statistical analyzing.

* Does it have interactivity, and how easy is it?

  With some package, R could support interactivity, but for the embedded visualization functions, it is not. In R Markdown, which created by RStudio and with other third party library like ggplot2, users could make interactive plots. Super easy to use. The language grammar is friendly for non-technical people. With one lines of code, user could create a bar plot inside R Markdown flies.

* What are the pros and cons of using it?

  Pros: Easy to draw plots for beginners. Tens of library to visualize data (include plotly, ggplot2, geofacet). For specific users who do not familiar with programming language, the software is easy to install and get used to the grammar. User friendly interface in RStudio (can check the data, document, install and upgrade packages in one button). Good documentations.

  Cons: Hard to customize. Not efficient in big data environment. Strict limitation in publication. Visualization largely depends on third party libraries.
